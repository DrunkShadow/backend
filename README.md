Make sure when adding new pdf models, they must have the entity's name upfront in the modelId, for example if you will add a worker's presentation model YOU MUST WRITE worker (...), (...) could be anything.
the folder containing entities' files such as images/files must be put in the 'public' directory, in a folder that has the attributes name, for instance if u have a workerSignature attribute that is a picture, there must be a folder in 'public' under the name 'workerSignature'
